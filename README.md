### What is SmartFish?

SmartFish is a simple, yet powerful, fish tank simulator. It is designed to be a fun and educational tool for anyone who
wants to learn more about fish and their environment. It is also a great tool for aquarium hobbyists to learn more about
their fish and how to keep them healthy.

.... Well thank GitHub Copilot for that description. I'm not sure if I agree with it, but it's a start.
I will make a better description by myself, ok Copilot ?

So ! SmartFish is initially a little project to let wake up your PC when you do another thing when you are at home.
You can retrieve at the top left of the application the current time, this time is written by your keyboard.
Like this your PC will think you are typing something and will not go to sleep.
And this is the main feature of SmartFish, it will keep your PC awake.

So now we can speak why I continue this project. Because when you are boring at work I want to allow you to play with my
application.
For the moment you can only play with a copy of the game "Place" but I will add more games in the future.
